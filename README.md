# Empty
Empty is an esoteric language designed to convert a sequence of keywords into a pure alphabetic sentence. It provides a set of keywords to the user to create a sequence to produce an alphabetic sentence. But the most unique feature of this particular esolang is that every keyword sounds like 'Empty' when they are pronounced.
