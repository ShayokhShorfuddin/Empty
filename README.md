# Empty ..
Empty is an esoteric language designed to convert a sequence of keywords into a pure alphabetic sentence. It provides a set of keywords to the user to create a sequence to produce an alphabetic sentence. But the most unique feature of this particular esolang is that every keyword sounds like 'Empty' when they are pronounced.

## How Does It Work?
Empty uses only 26 alphabetic characters to produce a sentence. It does not deal with symbols, number or any other character. The alphabets are arranged in a natural order which is a-z. A specific position has been assigned to every alphabet. For instance, a - 1, b - 2, c - 3 ... z - 26. 
### Keywords
```python
'empty' 'empt' 'mpty' 'emt' 'mpt' 'mty' 'mt'  // Lowercase Keywords
'^empty' '^empt' '^mpty' '^emt' '^mpt' '^mty' '^mt' // Uppercase Keywords
```
